# ML-projects


This project uses machine learning models to predict the selling price of used cars based on features like year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, present price, kilometers driven, and number of previous owners.
ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, SVR)

ðŸ“Š Dataset Features
Year, Present Price, Kms Driven

Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission

Owners, Selling Price

ðŸ§  Models Used
Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
RÂ² Score used for model accuracy

Random Forest gave the best performance

ðŸ“Œ Usage
Load dataset (car data.csv)

Preprocess data

Train & evaluate models

Visualize actual vs predicted prices

This project is ideal as a mini project for M.Tech students or for anyone interested in exploring regression techniques and model evaluation using a real-world dataset.
